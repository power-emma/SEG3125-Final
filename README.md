# SEG 3125 (UI Design) Final Project!
A website for a fictional computer retailer, selling computer components as well as systems
## Implemented Features
- Shopping Cart (Totals and Tax Calculations)
- Shop Page with Filterable Categories
- CPU/Motherboard Compatibility Checker (Warns you if you have for example an Intel Motherboard and AMD CPU)
- Bottleneck Checker (Notifies if one of your components will bring down overall system performance)
- Missing Component Checker (Warns you if you do not have an essential component for a complete system)
- Proof of Concept Language Switcher (Available on Home Page)

## Known Issues
- Poor Scaling Performance (Assignment Specified Standard Desktop Resolutions)
- Due to the website being front end only, there is no "check out" feature
